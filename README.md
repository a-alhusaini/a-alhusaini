### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm so glad you're reading this! I'm Abdullah Alhusaini, a freelance programmer with a passion for open source. Right now, I'm contributing to the Crystal community. More specifically, the Amber Framework.

Crystal's tagline is "Fast as C, slick as Ruby". Amber is Ruby on Rails. But for Crystal.

You can reach me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/a_a_alhusaiini) or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdullah-alhusaini-9932531b4/). I love meeting new people!

If you want to hire me, please fill out the contact form on my site: daarb.dev

Fun fact: I am visually impaired. "But its impossible! How do you use your editor"? No. If you're curious, get in touch and I'll show you my workflow. It'll be an eye-opener!
